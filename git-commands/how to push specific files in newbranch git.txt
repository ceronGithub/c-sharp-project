firstly create 2 branches
1 branch main, 2 branch develop


if you have 2 branches. 
* checkout to first branch
* type-in to terminal 'git checkout branch_name _type_the_full_file_path_and_type'
* git status : to double check if it found the file you are looking for

create new branch
* git checkout -b branch_name

then commit 
* git commit -m "comment"
* git push -u origin branch name nor git push

adding new specific file to the new branch
type in the ff:
* git checkout branch_name file_path_and_type
* git commit -m "comment"
* git push -u origin branch name nor git push
